<strong>2 Marks </strong>: 

Key Concepts:
Launch and Trajectory:

Projectile motion begins when an object is thrown, kicked, or otherwise launched into the air.
The path that the object follows is called its trajectory.
Components of Motion:

Horizontal Motion:
Describes the side-to-side movement of the projectile.
The horizontal motion remains constant unless influenced by external forces (e.g., air resistance).
Vertical Motion:
Describes the upward and downward movement of the projectile.
Affected by gravity, causing the object to accelerate downward.
Independence of Motions:

The horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other.
The horizontal motion is not affected by gravity, while the vertical motion is solely influenced by gravity.
Gravity's Influence:

Gravity acts vertically downward on the projectile.
It causes the object to accelerate downward, affecting its vertical velocity and creating a curved trajectory.
Characteristics of Projectile Motion:
Range:

The range is the horizontal distance covered by the projectile.
It depends on the initial speed and launch angle of the object.
Maximum Height:

The projectile reaches its maximum height during its trajectory.
The maximum height depends on the initial velocity and launch angle.
Real-World Examples:
Sports:

Projectile motion is evident in various sports like soccer, basketball, and baseball.
For example, when a basketball player shoots a ball into the hoop, the ball follows a projectile motion trajectory.
Fireworks:

Fireworks display is a spectacular example of projectile motion.
Fireworks are launched into the air, and their colorful patterns follow intricate projectile paths.
Projectiles in Nature:

Examples in nature include the motion of seeds ejected from plants or the trajectory of a thrown stone.
Practical Applications:
Engineering:

Engineers use the principles of projectile motion when designing and testing objects like missiles, rockets, or even in ballistics.
Entertainment:

Filmmakers and animators simulate realistic projectile motion to create captivating visual effects in movies and video games.
