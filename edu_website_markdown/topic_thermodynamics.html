<strong>2 Marks </strong>: 

1) An ideal gas, taken through an isothermal process, does 2000 J of work. Find the heat supplied to the gas.

2) A system releases 125 kJ of heat while 104 kJ of work is done on the system. Calculate the change in the internal energy.

3) Two moles of a gas expand isothermally at 300 K. If the initial volume of the gas is 23 L and the final volume is 46 L, find the work done by the gas on its surroundings. [R = 8.314 J/mol·K.

4) The initial pressure and volume of a gas enclosed in a cylinder are respectively 2 x 105 N/m² and 6 x 10-3 m3 . If the work done in compressing the e gas at constant pressure pressure is 150 J, find the final volume of the gas.

5) A monatomic gas at 27oC is adiabatically compressed to 80% of its initial volume. Find the final temperature of the gas.

6) A gas is adiabatically cooled from 27 °C to -45.6 °C. In the process, the pressure of the gas drops from 100 kPa to 50 kPa. Find the adiabatic ratio for the gas.

7) What is the thermal efficiency of a heat engine if in one cycle the work output is 3000 J and the heat input is 10000 J?

8) In one cycle, from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir. Calculate the efficiency a heat engine rejects 80% of the energy absorbed.

9) In a refrigerator, in one cycle, the external work done on the working substance is 20% of the energy extracted from the cold reservoir. Find the coefficient of performance of the refrigerator

10) The efficiency of a Carnot cycle/engine is 75%. If the temperature of the hot reservoir is 727 °C, calculate the temperature of the cold reservoir. 


<strong>3 Marks </strong> : 

1) 0.5 mole of a gas at a temperature of 450 K expands isothermally from 3L to 9L. (a) What is the work done by the gas? (b) How much heat is supplied to the gas? [R=8.319 J/mol-K]

2) A system is taken through a hypothetical thermodynamic cycle as shown. Calculate the work done along each path.

3) An ideal monatomic gas is adiabatically compressed so that its final temperature is twice its initial temperature. What is the ratio of the final pressure to its initial pressure?
