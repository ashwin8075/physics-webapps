# Rotational Dynamics

### *Moment Of Inertia*
<img src="large_Rotational-Movement.jpg">

The moment of inertia is defined as the product of mass of section and the square of the distance between the reference axis and the centroid of the section.
Spinning figure skaters can reduce their moment of inertia by pulling in their arms, allowing them to spin faster due to conservation of angular momentum.

Video of rotating chair experiment, illustrating moment of inertia. When the spinning professor pulls his arms, his moment of inertia decreases; to conserve angular momentum, his angular velocity increases.
The moment of inertia I is also defined as the ratio of the net angular momentum L of a system to its angular velocity ω around a principal axis of rotation that goes through the origin, that is
